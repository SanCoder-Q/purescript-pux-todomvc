# PureScript + Pux â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)
> Pux is a PureScript interface to React, similar to the Elm app architecture. It is a simple pattern for modular, nested components that are easy to test, refactor, and debug - making it simple and straightforward to build complex web applications.
